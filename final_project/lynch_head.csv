ENDORSES THE dyer


BILL",,advancement of colored people fifth avenue new york today made public statement from bolton smith of memphis tennessee president in of the local rotary club and a trustee of the university of tennes see endorsing the dyer antilynch ing bill which is to come to a vote in the senate during the next session of congress the statement of mr smith was said to be especially significant by james weldon johnson secretary of the advancement association in that mr smith declared the bill contained no special attack upon the south mr smith in his statement declares the crime of lynching is next to the assassination of a prominent off ger of the nation one of the greatest which can be committed t is crime against the nation in a very real sense and therefore should be triable by federal courts mr smiths statement in full is as follows september th il am in favor of the dyer bill giving federal courts jurisdiction in connec ton with the crime of lynch ing under certain cases because il l believe that local sentiment in many places is too strong to permit local authorities to enforce the law against mobs a trial before jury in a united states court is not trial be fore an alien tribunal but the jury is selected from the people of the en tire state or district and one is as sured of a more impartial jury one not terrorized by that local sentiment which usually is so blatant after any mob action few officers have the courage to oppose strong local senti ment so there is no special attack on the south in such a measure t is re quired by the progress of the country north as well as south as common negro labor has moved into the north negroes have been lynched by white mobs there too that some southern men who sin cerely oppose lynching should not ia vor the dyer bill is due to misap prehension of its effect and purpose there is no part of the united states in which those favoring the due pro cess of law for the punishment of crime should not be in favor of the punishment of lynchers by federal courts whenever local officials fail to do their duty a the lynching of negroes by white mobs is bad enough but there is some danger that we will before long be faced with an even more dan gerous character of lynching namely the lynching of those of one religious faith by those of another faith this would divide america into hostile camps and produce civil war and we need law that will enable the fed eral courts to repress these cases with the utmost severity the crime of lynching is next to the assassination of a prominent officer of the nation one of the great est which can be committed this is especially so where t is performed by one class or race and suffered by an other which other race or class re cards the lynching as an attack against every one of its members a lynching in georgia tends to disturb labor conditions not only in the ad joining states but in the entire south and is not without its effect in en bittering race relations in the north t cannot be regarded as merely against the peace and dignity of the state within whose limits it is com mitted its evil effect spreads far be yond those limits t is crime against the nation in a very real sense and therefore should be triable by federal courts l do not assume that this law will immediately stop lynching but it will be one step in that direction above all it would impress the off cials of every state with the determin alton of the people at large to stop this crime the effect of few trials in the federal courts will be highly beneficial signed bolton smith
